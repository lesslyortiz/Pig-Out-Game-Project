Description:
The main purpose of our project was to create a simple, cute, zen game that allows users to play it as a relaxing distraction. Another main purpose for our game is to celebrate the memory of the beloved Chicken the guinea pig who shall now live on in this game. The basic premise of our game is that we have our main sprite, Chicken the guinea pig, and we are moving him around so that he can eat his favorite food which in our case is cilantro. We need to feed Chicken some cilantro until his food meter is at maximum quantity, then once Chicken is “full” the game ends. Although it might not seem much, there are a lot of other aspects about the game that should soothe the user while playing it. Again, it was supposed to be a short and simple game that didn’t require a lot of strategy or decision making. It’s just about a hungry guinea pig that likes to eat cilantro. The intended audience for the game was really supposed to be of all ages since the mechanics of the game mostly require a mouse and the arrow keys. If we were gonna rate it on the gaming scale that i guess ‘Pig Out!’ would be rated E for everyone since it is such an adorable and happy little game.


List of known bugs:
- The score may start off displaying a score greater than '0/10' cilantros. This is because a cilantro may randomly start within range of the character when the game starts and gets counted as a collision with the food item.

- The user character, chicken, may regularly appear to collide with the food but is not counted as a collision where the food does not relocate and the score does not increase. This may be avoided by aiming for the food items with the user's rear end as the program detects collison 40 pixels from around the character's rear end.

- If this program is ran on a python IDLE, there will be issues with the user's movement border and the background image will shift due to the way this program was needed to be coded because of Repl.it's pygame window size limits.
